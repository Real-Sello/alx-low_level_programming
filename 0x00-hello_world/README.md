## ðŸ’¡ Learning Objectives

- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)
- What happens when you type ```gcc main.c```
- What is an entry point
- What is ```main```
- How to print text using ```printf```, ```puts``` and ```putchar```
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator ```sizeof```
- How to compile using ```gcc```
- What is the default program name when compiling with ```gcc```
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with ```betty-style```
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the ```main``` function influence the return value of the program

## :pencil: Project Tasks

- ### [0. Preprocessor](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
	- We were tasked to write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
		- The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```
		- The output should be saved in the file ```c```
___		
- ### [1. Compiler](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
	- We were tasked to write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
		-The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```
		- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension ```.o``` instead of ```.c.```
			- Example: if the C file is ```main.c```, the output file should be ```main.o```
___
- ### [2. Assembler](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
	- We were tasked to write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
		- The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```
		- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension ```.s``` instead of ```.c.```
			- Example: if the C file is ```main.c```, the output file should be ```main.s```
___
- ### [3. Name](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name)
	- We were tasked to write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named ```cisfun```.
		- The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```
___
- ### [4. Hello, puts](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)
	- We were tasked to write a C program that prints exactly ```"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle```, followed by a new line.

		- Use the function ```puts```
		- We are not allowed to use ```printf```
		- Our program should end with the value ```0```
___		
- ### [5. Hello, printf](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)
	- We were tasked to write a C program that prints exactly ```with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,```, followed by a new line.

		- Use the function printf
		- We are not allowed to use the function ```puts```
		- Our program should return ```0```
		- Our program should compile without warning when using the ```-Wall``` ```gcc``` option
___
- ### [6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)
	- We were tasked to write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

		- We should produce the exact same output as in the example
		- Warnings are allowed
		- Our program should return ```0```
		- We had to install the package ```libc6-dev-i386``` on our Linux to test the ```-m32``` ```gcc``` option
___		
- ### [7. Intel](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)
	- We were tasked to write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

		- The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```.
		- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension ```.s``` instead of ```.c```.
			- Example: if the C file is ```main.c```, the output file should be ```main.s```
___			
- ### [8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity](https://github.com/Real-Sello/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c) **|** ```ADVANCED TASK```

	- We were tasked to write a C program that prints exactly ```and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19```, followed by a new line, to the standard error.

		- We are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) ```printf``` or man (3) ```puts```
		- Our program should return 1
		- Our program should compile without any warnings when using the ```-Wall``` ```gcc``` option
