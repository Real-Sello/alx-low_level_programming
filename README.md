# Low-Level Programming & Algorithm - Hatching Out.

## Description

Welcome aboard, this repo has all the low level programming tasks I was able to complete with the [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Software Engineering Programme guidelines and course resources. The focus of these tasks is learning the C Programming Language.
